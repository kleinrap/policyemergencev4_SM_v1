Can also have a capacity sub-sector to explicitly include institutional constraints or can just include a constraining multipler on effect on renovation and construction. Then assume sufficient design capacity. Safety assessment capacity limitations could be included by reducing official current safety

Different countries make different choices regarding current and design safety standards even under the same Anticipated Flood Level. They also do not automatically renovate.
